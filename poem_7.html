        goodbye my dear friend, 
        you may have left this world to go to a better place 
        but know this, that my heart will always have your trace 
        what you mean to me and my life, it no one can replace
        and your name on the seat next to me, I'll never erase

        goodbye my dear friend,
        today you finish the race, today you are free
        I'll forever cherish the memories I had with thee
        and I pray to god to keep you happy, wherever you may be
        and I hope the spot by your side is forever reserved for me

        goodbye my dear friend ...
