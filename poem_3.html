            oh how much i want things were like before,
            why can't we give us a chance once more,
            coz you are the one I was living for,
            but sometimes you just never reach the shore,
            and time leaves open no door.

            Just want to send you an apology I owe,
            standing in pain, there is one thing I know,
            that I am the barrier to your happiness and so,
            I will clear the path and take the blow, 
            Coz true love is about letting go.
