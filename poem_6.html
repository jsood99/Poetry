    <h1> Rhythm of life </h1>
    <br>
    <br>
    <pre>
        I was walking alone, just another day
        In the crowd that I saw, you were making your way
        like shade in the sun an angel from heaven
        dont know what was holding me back to say
        
        that you are the rhythm of life, you are my fame
        and my heart skips a beat, when you take my name
        darling will love you forever, no matter whatever
        no matter you dont love me the same
        
        couldnt move my feet, to go say 'hey'
        But she was the one, to god I pray
        dont know what to do, theres a fear of loosing you
        In the crowd Im still alone wanting to say
        
        that you are my burning desire, you are my flame
        you are that precious jewel I can never claim
        darling will love you forever, no matter whatever
        no matter you dont love me the same
        
        I wonder how long I am gonna stay
        cant be looking at her, while she walks away,
        I gotta be a man, hold her hand in my hand,
        I gotta make a move, I gotta say
        
        baby my life turned around when you came
        what you mean to me I can never explain
        darling will love you forever, no matter whatever
        no matter you dont love me the same
        
        darling will love you forever, forever and ever
        even if you dont love me the same....
